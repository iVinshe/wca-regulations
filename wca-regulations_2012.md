The report must be submitted to the WCA Board within one week of the competition date. [NOTE BY SARAH: To whom are reports required to be made available? Are they closed to the Board, between the Board and the organisation team, or open to the public/WCA community? This ought to be specified.]
    - 1c3) Sending the competition results to the WCA Results Team. [NOTE BY SARAH: Who/what is the Results Team? This needs to be defined in the document, or else a referred definition ought to be provided.] Results should be ready at the end of the last day of competition. [NOTE: Move to Guidelines]
    - 1c3a) All scrambles used during a competition must be sent with the results of the competition.

## Article 2: Competitors
- 2a) Any person is permitted to [NOTE BY LUCAS: exact phrasing?] compete in a WCA competition, if he:
    - 2a1) complies with WCA regulations;
    - 2a2) meets the competition requirements, which must be clearly announced before the competition;
    - 2a3) is not suspended by WCA Board.
- 2b) Competitors below the age of 18 must obtain consent from their parent(s)/guardian(s) to register and compete.
- 2c) Competitors must provide all information required by the organization team (minimally comprising: name, country, date of birth, gender, contact information, selected events) for their registration to be considered complete.
    - 2c1) A competitor shall not be eligible to compete without a completed registration. [NOTE BY SARAH: Please decide the exact person(s) who shall determine the composition of a "complete registration," and use one designation for said person(s) throughout. In the space of two sub-articles, you've used "organisation team," "competition organiser" and "WCA Delegate".]
- 2d) All information (except: name, country, date of birth [NOTE BY SARAH: I find it hard to believe that date of birth is not considered confidential. Most organisations (especially online transactions/registries) will not release DOBs for fear of identity theft/fraud liability], gender, selected events and competition results [NOTE BY SARAH: also, given the breadth of such exceptions, what personal information remains protected?]) must be used for the competition only, and may only be disclosed to outside organisations/persons with the consent of the competitor. A competitor's date of birth is considered confidential information, and must never be shared with other parties without prior consent of the competitor or legal guardian, as applicable.
- 2e) Competitors must [NOTE BY LUCAS: Rephrease using "must"] represent a countries of which they hold citizenship. The WCA Delegate should verify citizenship standing by means of  documents (e.g. a passport). If a competitor is found ineligible to represent the country under which they have registered, the competitor may be retroactively disqualified and/or suspended at the discretion of the WCA Board.
    - 2e1a) The eligible countries are defined by Wikipedia List of sovereign states ("Internationally recognized sovereign states" and "Other states"). [NOTE BY SARAH: Why Wikipedia? You could use the UN list, or something actually recognized by sovereign governments.]
    - 2e2) Competitors with more than one citizenship [NOTEL: This doesn't technically account for citizenship changes] may change their country of representation in their first competition of a calendar year.
- 2f) Competitors must obey venue regulations and conduct themselves in a manner considerate of others.
- 2g) Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from active competitors [NOTE BY LUCAS: Was "those competing". Resolve.].
- 2h) Competitors shall be fully dressed while in the competition venue. At the discretion of the Delegate, competitors may be disqualified for inappropriate clothing.
    - 2h1) Exception: Competitors may be barefoot if 3x3x3 Feet Solving is being held at the competition.
- 2i) While competing, competitors must not use sound  or other electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones, MP3 players, dictaphones, or additional lighting).
- 2j) The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor who fails arrive in time for a round of any event.
- 2k) A competitor may be disqualified from a competition by the WCA Delegate if:
    - 2k1) The competitor fails to show up in time for registration for the competition.
    - 2k2) The competitor is suspect of cheating or defrauding the officials during the competition.
    - 2k3) The competitor behaves in a way that is unlawful, violent or indecent; or intentionally damages venue facilities or personal property within the venue.

- 2n) Competitors may verbally dispute a ruling to the WCA Delegate.
- 2o) Disputes are only permitted during the competition, within 30 minutes after the disputed incident happened and before the start of the next round of the event.
- 2p) The WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute before the start of the next round of the event.
- 2q) Disputes are only permitted within the parameters of the discretion of the organisation team. [NOTE BY SARAH: This is extremely vague; I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean. Are there actual parameters (and if so, are they listed anywhere in this document?)? If there are parameters, then how much leeway is afforded "the discretion of the organisation team?"]
- 2r) The competitor must accept the final ruling of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the competitor from the competition.The final ruling of the WCA Delegate may not be disputed; further dispute may lead to disqualification of the competitor in question. [NOTE BY SARAH: Perhaps you should find some way to replace all instances of "Penalty:" with a full sentence, as demonstrated above.]
    - 2s1) For competitors with hearing disabilities, judges may replace the vocal instructions with hand signals.
    - 2s2) For competitors with physical disabilities, judges may give help with starting and stopping the timer.
    - 2s3) Competitors with other disabilities that may prevent them from abiding by one or more Competition Regulations may request special accommodations with the WCA Delegate. Such accommodations must be noted in the Delegate Report. [NOTE BY SARAH: All sub-articles (e.g. 2s) with sub-points (e.g. 2s1) should have a heading at the sub-article level.]
- 2t) All competitors should be familiar with and understand the WCA regulations before the competition.

## Article 3: Puzzles
- 3a) Competitors must provide their own puzzles for the competition. Competitors may borrow puzzles from other competitors.
    - 3a1) Competitors must be present and ready to compete when they are called to compete for a round. [NOTE BY LUCAS: revise] Penalty: disqualification from the event.
- 3b) Puzzles must be in fully operational, such that normal scrambling is possible.
- 3c) Polyhedral puzzles must use a colour scheme with one colour per face in the solved state.  All puzzle variations must have moves, positions and solutions functionally identical to the original puzzle.
- 3d) Puzzles must have coloured stickers, coloured tiles, textures or painted/printed colours. Textured puzzles must have uniform texture patterns throughout. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Sarah had "throughout"]  Competitors with a medically documented visual disability may use textured puzzles with different textures on each face. Textures/patterns must be uniform per face.
    - 3d1) Textured puzzles must have different colours on each face to aid in scrambling and judging.
- 3e) The colours of puzzles must be solid and of uniform shade per face; each colour on the puzzle must be clearly distinct from other colours thereupon.
- 3f) Stickers/tiles/textures/paint must not be thicker than 1.5 mm, or the generally available thickness for non-cube puzzles.
- 3g) Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding or applying any form of lubricant.
- 3h) Modifications that enhance the basic concept of a puzzle are not permitted. Examples of such enhancement include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, more or other solved states. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Guideline?]
- 3i) "Pillowed" and other modified versions of puzzles are permitted if and only if the modification does not make any additional information available to the competitor (e.g. identity of faces) [from any possible angle of the puzzle in any possible configuration NOTE BY SARAH: this is confusing and possibly unnecessary.], as compared to a non-pillowed version of the same puzzle. This is subject to the following exceptions and clarifications:
    - 3i1) Exception to 3i: Pillowed 7x7x7 cubes are permitted.
    - 3i2) "Stickerless" cubes, and other cubes whose face colours are visible inside the cube, are not permitted.
- 3j) Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance by a competitor are not grounds for additional attempts.
- 3k) Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that distinguish one piece from any similar piece.
- 3l) Puzzles must be approved by  the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.
- 3m) Cube puzzles must have at most one logo. For the Rubik's Cube or bigger cube puzzles the logo must be placed on one of the centre pieces.
    - 3m1) Colourless engravings (max. 1 per colour) are not considered as logos.
- 3n) All brands of puzzles and puzzle parts are allowed, as long as the puzzles comply with all WCA regulations.

## Article 4: Scrambling
- 4a) A scrambler must apply the scramble sequences.
- 4b) Puzzles must be scrambled using computer-generated random scramble sequences or scrambled positions available only to the WCA Delegate and the scrambler. [NOTE BY SARAH: The "must" employed at the beginning of the sentence applies to all clauses in said sentence -- no need to write it in twice.] Generated scrambles must not be inspected before the competition, and must not be filtered or selected in any way by the WCA Delegate.
- 4d) Cube puzzles and Megaminx must be scrambled with the white (otherwise the lightest colour) face on top and green (or the darkest adjacent face by default) on the front. Pyraminx must be scrambled with the yellow (or the lightest colour by default) face on bottom and green (or the darkest adjacent colour by default) on the front. Square-1 must be scrambled with the darkest colour on front (out of the 2 possible scrambling orientations).
- 4f) Competition scrambles must be generated using the current official version of the official WCA scrambling program (available via the WCA website). [NOTE BY LUCAS: How do we make clear that the redundancy is intentional?]

## Article 5: Puzzle Defects
- 5a) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped pieces; broken wires; and detached screws,caps, and stickers.
- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during the solve, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the solve, or to stop the solve.
    - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, he must repair only the defective pieces. Tools and/or pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b2) Any repair to a puzzle must not give the competitor any advantage in solving said puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b3) If, after repairing the puzzle but before the end of the solve, the competitor finds that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and assemble a maximum of 4 pieces to make the puzzle solvable.
    - 5b4) In blindfolded events, a puzzle defect may only be repaired during the solve, and all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b5) If, at the end of the solve [NOTE BY LUCAS: Moving this before the next comma would be better, if we didn't have app those parentheses], parts of the puzzle (e.g. a centre cap of a cube) are still defective or not fully rotated (e.g. a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot), the result shall be recorded as the worst state obtainable via reassembly of the puzzle (e.g. a pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states one fully solved, and two "+2" states; the solve would be recorded as a "+2" state).
- 5c) If a competitor has a puzzle defect, this does not give him the right to an extra attempt.

## Article 7: Environment
- 7a) Competitions may be held at any location, indoors or outdoors.
- 7b) Spectators must remain at least 1.50 meters away from the competition stage when it is in use. [NOTE BY LUCAS: when... competitors are using it... for official solves?]
- 7c) Lighting of the competition area must be given special attention. [NOTE BY SARAH: Is this an advisory or a regulation?] White light is preferred, such that competitors may easily differentiate among the colours on the puzzles. [NOTE BY SARAH: If the latter clause is necessary, perhaps "such that competitors may readily differentiate between the colours on the puzzles."]
- 7e) The competition area must be smoke-free.
- 7f) The timer must be attached to the mat and placed directly on the table, desk or other suitable console, with the timer on the side of the mat nearest to the competitor. [NOTE BY SARAH: Specify -- near to whom/what? The competitor? The judge? e.g. "the side of the mat nearest the competitor".] The mat must be placed flush against the surface of the table.
    - 7f1) Exception: In Feet Solving the timer must be placed directly on the floor. The timer device may [NOTE BY SARAH: is this an advisory or a regulation?] be placed on the far side of the mat. [NOTE BY SARAH: again, specify -- is this the far side from the competitor's perspective?]
- 7h) The competition area must have a competitors area. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Competitors Area, capitalized?)
    - 7h1) A competitor who have been called to compete must remain within the competitors area until he has completed all of his solves for the round. [NOTE BY SARAH: does this mean all of their own solves of the round, or all the solves of all competitors in the round?] [NOTE BY LUCAS: Should we add a sentence like "Competitors who are not competing and currently helping run the competition must not be in the competitors area."? That would be hard to phrase ("helping out" is vague, but how else do you encapsulate "judging, scrambling, or otherwise helping the organizatino team"), and it would probably get violated quite a bit in some competition scenarios.]
    - 7h3) Competitors in the competitors area must not communicate with each other about the scrambled positions of the puzzles of the round in progress. Penalty: disqualification of competitor at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.

## Article 8: Competitions
- 8a) An official WCA competition must:
    - 8a1) be approved by the WCA Board.
    - 8a2) follow the WCA Regulations.
    - 8a3) have a WCA Delegate (appointed by WCA Board) in attendance.
    - 8a4) be announced on the WCA website at least two weeks  before the start of the competition.
    - 8a6) be publicly accessible.
    - 8a7) use the authentic Speedstacks Stackmat timer (Generation 2 or Pro) for time measurement.
    - 8a8) be open, by default, to all who wish to compete. Restrictions must be approved by the WCA Board and clearly stated on the competition website when the competition is announced.
- 8b) If WCA regulations are not correctly observed at any point during a competition, the WCA Board may declare affected events or solves, or the competition as a whole, invalid. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Does this sound like a good way to phrase "refuse to accep the results"?]

## Article 9: Events
- 9a) The WCA governs competitions for:
    - puzzles known as Rubik puzzles; and [NOTE BY LUCAS: Took out "all" because e.g. Magics are not necessarily "governed" by the WCA]
    - other puzzles that are manipulated by twisting the sides, commonly known as 'twisty puzzles'.

- 9b) The official events and formats of the WCA are:
    - 9b1) Rubik's Cube, 2x2x2 Cube, 4x4x4 Cube, 5x5x5 Cube, Clock, Magic, Master Magic, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1, Rubik's Cube: One-handed and Rubik's Cube: With Feet. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [NOTE BY SARAH: define 'x' here (e.g. "where 'x' is an integer between three and seven, inclusive")] and 'Average of Five' [NOTE BY SARAH: Choose a consistent style for numbers throughout the document (either use the Arabic numeral or spell out the number in English), excepting cube size designations. I won't take the time to correct them -- that would be kind of pointless -- just choose one and do it yourself.]

    - 9b2) 6x6x6 Cube and 7x7x7 Cube. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [see NOTE in 8b1] and 'Average of Three' [NOTE BY SARAH: Unless "average" and "mean" have different definitions as used here, you should use the same word in both clauses.]

    - 9b3) Rubik's Cube: Fewest moves, Rubik's Cube: Blindfolded, 4x4x4 Cube: Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Cube: Blindfolded and Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded. 

      Permissible competition formats for these events include: 'Best of x' [see NOTE in 9b1]

- 9e) New official events may be added, and existing official events removed, each calendar year. [NOTE FROM LUCAS: We're keeping the calendar year rule, right? So… beginning of each calendar year?]
    - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback from the WCA delegates and the community.
    - 9e4) Events other than those specified in article 9b may be held during a competition, but will be considered unofficial and therefore will not be included in the official results of the competition.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes and corresponding averages/means are measured in hundredths of a second, with averages/means rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second (x.009 becomes x.00, x.010 becomes x.01). [NOTE BY SARAH: choose either the term "average" or the term "mean" and use it consistently throughout the document. No need to have both. I'll stop commenting on this henceforth -- just pick one and use it throughout.] [NOTE BY LUCAS: Averages and means do have a distinction, but this certainly doesn't make sense here on someone's first read-through. Improve?]
    - 9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes and corresponding averages/means are measured in seconds, with averages/means rounded to the nearest second (x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) The result of a solve shall be recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the solve is disqualified or unfinished.
    - 9f5) The result of a solve shall be recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if a competitor skips an attempt during a round.
    - 9f6) For 'Best of x' rounds, competitors are each allotted x (at most 3) attempts. [NOTE BY SARAH: The meaning is vague. Do you mean that x is less than or equal to 3? In that case, write "competitors are allotted x attempts. x may/shall/must not exceed 3."] The best result of x attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round. The organization team may enforce a cumulative time limit for the event, e.g. 30 minutes for 'Best of 2'.
    - 9f7) For 'Best of x' rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result. If all results are DNF and/or DNS, the best result of the competitor is recorded as DNF. [NOTE BY SARAH: Is the second sentence really necessary?] [NOTE BY LUCAS: For thoroughness, yes. Guideline?]
    - 9f8) For 'Average of 5' rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be removed, and the mean of the remaining 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f9) For 'Average of 5' rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of said round. If a competitor receives more than one DNF and/or DNS in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.
    - 9f10) For 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The mean of the 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f11) For 'Mean of 3' rounds, if the competitor scores at least one DNF or DNS, his average score for the round is DNF.
    - 9f12) For 'Best of x' rounds rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "best" is defined as the shortest recorded time. [NOTE BY LUCAS: This needs to be generalized for FMC, and maybe events like multi BLD]
    - 9f13) For 'Mean of x' and 'Average of x' rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is defined as the shortest recorded time. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Redo this.]
    - 9f14) For 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, said competitors' rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "best" is defined as the shortest recorded time.
    - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive identical rankings for the round.
    - 9f16) For the [Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded NOTE BY SARAH: it took me a while to figure out what this meant. In the final document, please bold or italicise the names of the events to minimize confusion.] event, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is superior. If the difference is less than 0, the result shall be disqualified. [NOTE BY SARAH: as a rule of thumb, use "shall be" if the sentence uses a conditional clause (i.e. "if"); otherwise, use "is/are."] If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is superior. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles said competitors fail to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are superior. [NOTE BY SARAH: perhaps this paragraph ought to be split into multiple clauses. It's a bit dense, especially for the layperson.]
- 9g) A Combined Round consists of two phases of solves, where competitors advance to the second phase only if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase. [NOTE BY SARAH: this definition needs serious reworking. I still don't think I could define it if you asked me.]
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided on position (best x competitors) or on result (all competitors with a best result under x). [NOTE BY SARAH: I have no idea what this means. Doesn't this directly contradict the clause above it?]
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings. [NOTE BY SARAH: this (9i and its sub-clauses) seems extremely out of place. Isn't there some other article in this document that discusses the website?]
    - 9i1) The WCA shall recognize the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.
    - 9i2) Results of official WCA competitions are dated to the calendar date of the competition. Should a competition span multiple days, the results of each round are dated to the last scheduled calendar date of the round.
    - 9i3) If the regulations for an event are changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new regulations.
- 9j) Each event must be held only once per competition. [NOTE BY LUCAS: At most once?]
- 9k) All competitors may [NOT: are eligbile to?] participate in all events of a competition.
- 9l) Each round must be finished before any following round of the same event starts. 
- 9m) Events must have at most four rounds.
    - 9m1) Events with 99 or fewer competitors must have at most three rounds.
    - 9m2) Events with 15 or fewer competitors must have at most two rounds.
    - 9m3) Events with 7 or fewer competitors must have at most one round.
- 9o) A Combined round and a Qualification round count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.
- 9p) If an event has multiple rounds, competitors 
    - 9p1) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.
    - 9p2) The competitors who advance to the next round shall be determined by either a cutoff rank or a cutoff time in the preceeding elimination round, the latter to be specified before the preceeding elimination round begins. [NOTE BY LUCAS: Just the latter? We need stricter enforcement of this, anyhow.]
    - 9p3) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, he may be replaced by the best-scoring competitor below the cutoff from the preceeding round. [NOTE BY SARAH: there's inconsistent usage of "score" vs. "time" -- you ought to clear that up]
- 9r) A qualification round is held before the first round of an event. [NOTE BY SARAH: this (important!) definition needs to appear before 9g.]
    - 9r1) When announcing an event, the organisation team must include:
        - the number of competitors in the first round of the event
        - the maximum number of competitors permitted in the qualification round of the event, and the number of said competitors who will proceed to the first round
        - the average/mean time or single solve time, achieved in previous competition, required to qualify directly for the first round of the event
        - the latest permitted date used to determine the qualifiying average/mean time or single solve time on the WCA ranking of each competitor [NOTE BY SARAH: still confused about this. You fix it.] [NOTE BY LUCAS: Still needs fixing.]
    - 9r2) All competitors of an event who have not directly qualified for the first round of the event must compete in the qualification round in order to participate in the first round.
    - 9r3) A qualification round may be added to accommodate newly registered competitors, and/or the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round or first round of an event may be increased. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.
- 9s) Each round of each event must have a time limit. If a competitor does not solve within the time limit, the judge may terminate and disqualify the solve. The The competitor may be allowed to continue the round, at the discretion of the WCA delegate.

## Article 10: Solved state
- 10b) Only the resting state of the puzzle, after the timer has stopped, is considered.
- 10c) Puzzles may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to the puzzle in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5 Puzzle defects.
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reassembled and all parts are aligned within the limits specified below:
    - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (e.g. two parallel adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Article 10f, the puzzle shall be considered to require one additional move to solve (Half Turn Metric). [NOTE BY SARAH: what is a Half Turn Metric? Is this described elsewhere in the document? If not, define it here. As a general rule, all specialised terminology should be defined at the point in the document that where it first appears, even if said definition is merely a reference to another part of the document.]
    - 10e2) If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state, the puzzle shall be considered solved without penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is required, the puzzle shall be considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds.
    - 10e4) If more than one move is required, the solve is ruled DNF.
- 10f) Limits of acceptable misalignment for puzzles:
    - cube-shaped puzzles: =< 45 degrees
    - Megaminx: =< 36 degrees
    - Pyraminx: =< 60 degrees
    - Square-1: =< 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/)

Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45°
