    - 9f7) For 'Best of X' rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
    - 9f8) For 'Average of 5' rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be removed, and the mean of the remaining 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f9) For 'Average of 5' rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor receives more than one DNF and/or DNS in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.

      - 9f12a) "Better" is defined as the shorter recorded time.
      - 9f12b) For Rubik's Cube: Fewest Moves Solving, "better" is defined as the shorter solution length.
      - 9f12c) For Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, the result is disqualified. If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors fail to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.
    - 9f13) For 'Mean of 3' and 'Average of X' rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the shorter recorded time.
    - 9f14) For 'Mean of 3' and 'Average of X' rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "better" is defined as the shorter recorded time.

Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45Â° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45Â° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45Â°

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45Â° Solved = no penalty

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Attempts for events categorised under Speed Solving must abide by the following procedure.
    - A1a) The organization team may enforce time limits for attempts and/or rounds.
    - A1a1) The default time limit per attempt is 10 minutes, though the organization team may announce a higher/lower time limit.
    - A1a2) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a "DNF" result counts towards the cumulative time limit.

      - A1b1) Simultaneous use of a Stackmat is optional.
      - A1b2) If the Stackmat time is available, it is the result; otherwise the stopwatch time is the result. 
    - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements. A competitor competing with expectation of a "DNF" result may be disqualified from the event at the discretion of the Delegate.

    - A2c) After the scrambler starts the scramble, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the the inspection phase begins.
    - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge shall briefly inspect the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of said puzzle. The judge shall raise any concerns with the scrambler, who shall then conduct a detailed check.
    - A2e) The judge shall place the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation and shall cover it completely. The competitor must not request a specific orientation.
- A3) Inspection
    - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle before beginning each solve.

    - A4b) The competitor must place his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the start of the solve. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4d) The competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer, thereby starting the timer.

    - A7b1) If penalties are applied, the judge shall record the result displayed on the timer, and record the penalty adjacent, in the format "X + T + Y = F", where X represents a sum total of penalties incurred before a solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum total of penalties incurred during/after a solve, and F represents the final result. If the value of X and/or Y is zero, the relevant term is omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
    - A7c) The judge and competitor must both sign the score sheet to acknowledge the result. Should either of them refuse to sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate may sign in their place.
